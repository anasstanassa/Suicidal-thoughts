        <h1 style="color: red;">Why does our brain allow us to be depressed or sad?</h1>
        <p style="color: white;">
            Reality suggests we may need to be sad, unhappy right now, if we want to ensure happiness in the future. We
            may even have to go through pain in the present, do work and think hard to get there. And given the nature
            of reality when you actually look at it, this may continue to be so into the future - there is no perfectly
            happy resting place.

            A happy brain is an idiot brain.

        <h1 style="color: red;">Why do I feel suicidal?</h1>
        <p style="color: white;">Suicidal feelings can affect anyone, of any age, gender or background, at any time.

            If you are feeling suicidal it is likely that you have felt increasingly hopeless and worthless for some
            time. You may not know what has caused you to feel this way but it is often a combination of factors:
        <ul style="color: white;" class="ul">
            <li>mental health problems </li>
            <li>bullying or discrimination</li>
            <li>different types of abuse</li>
            <li>money problems </li>
            <li>housing problems</li>
            <li>addiction </li>
            <li>cultural pressure</li>
            <li>doubts about your sexual or gender identity</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h1 style="color: red;">  Start discussing your suicidal thoughts with others. </h1>
        <p style="color: white;">Talking about these thoughts can be tough. You may not know how to start sharing them with others like your family and friends,so the best way to begin a discussion about these thoughts is to just be as straightforward as possible. 
             But you might also worry about their potential responses,don't worry. Keep in mind that loved ones might have a strong reaction to hearing your statements.
              Talking about mental health with loved ones can be very helpful.
              </p>

              <h1 style="color: red;">Alcohol and other drug abuse increase the risk for suicide.</h1>
              <p style="color: white;">Instead of drinking it away, smoking it away, sit with it, a large part of healing happens by feeling and facing it.</p>
